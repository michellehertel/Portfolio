# About Me
My name is Michelle Hertel, I'm a first-year student at Carnegie Mellon, getting a masters in Public Policy and Management. I'm in the DC track, which means I'll be spending my second year in DC, working a fellowship while completing my remaining coursework. I came to CMU after working as an Americorps VISTA member at a non-profit law firm in Upstate New York for 18 months. Currently, I work at the Women's Law Project in Pittsburgh, where I manage a project that examines whether public schools provide equal funding to boys and girls sports teams.

My goal in earning a masters degree is to gain the skills to be an effective researcher and data analyst, and ultimately to join a think tank or the government doing work aimed at expanding voter participation and increasing the responsiveness of government to the people. In my free time, I like reading (as many books as possible), taking my dog for hikes, and playing piano or listening to music.

# What I Hope to Learn
Through this Telling Stories with Data class, I hope to learn more about creating visual representations of data in a way that makes the most sense and is easy to understand. Additionally, I hope to learn the most effective strategies for creating impactful data visualizations, and the tools that can be most beneficial in doing that.

This will be where I collect data visualizations for my Telling Stories with Data class!
